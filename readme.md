# DS3 CycleGAN Implementation

## Setup

- Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
  - Recommend using a mamba/conda environment, so your packages can be separated. (make sure you activate the environment after making it)
  - After activating environment, use pip for PyTorch
    - The command on the website also installs torchvision, which is needed for images

## Development

- When working on something, git checkout a new branch, and work inside that branch
- Then you can push that branch and make a pull request when ready to be merged with main

## Implementation

- Using implementation (section 4) in [CycleGAN Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593)
- Template files have been created, feel free to add/change the functions, classes, files as it's not a hard writeup yet
- Also, we don't have to follow the paper super strict, it just might be easier to follow them in the beginning and then add try our own stuff later
